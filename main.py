Disc Track Splitter - GUI entry point.

Workflow:
    1. Pick (or watch) a folder containing a ripped Blu-ray disc structure
       (BDMV/PLAYLIST/*.mpls).
    2. Scan playlists, auto-select the best candidate (an Atmos track if
       the disc has one, based on the same scoring as before).
    3. Choose which audio track to keep - Atmos is pre-selected when
       present, otherwise the best lossless option is, but every track
       the playlist actually has (LPCM, DTS-HD MA, TrueHD, in whatever
       channel layouts/sample rates the disc offers) is listed and can be
       picked instead.
    4. Enter/paste song names for each chapter.
    5. Extract the chosen audio track + split into individually named files.

HELP_TEXT = """DISC TRACK SPLITTER - TIPS & TROUBLESHOOTING

WORKFLOW
1. Point the source field at a folder containing a ripped Blu-ray disc
   (it needs the standard BDMV/PLAYLIST/*.mpls structure - not a
   flattened single MKV), by typing/pasting the path, hitting Enter, or
   using Browse. It scans automatically - no Scan button needed.
2. The app inspects every playlist and ranks them by likelihood of
   being "the" concert/album feature - has an Atmos track, has
   chapters, includes video, sensible duration. If there's only one
   plausible candidate it's picked automatically and the reasoning is
   shown right there; the playlist dropdown only appears when two or
   more candidates are genuinely close enough to be worth choosing
   between yourself.
3. Pick which audio track to keep. If the playlist has a Dolby Atmos
   track it's pre-selected automatically (matching the old behaviour);
   otherwise the best lossless option is pre-selected. Every audio
   track the playlist actually has - different codecs, channel layouts
   (2.0/5.1/7.1), sample rates, whatever the disc offers - is listed in
   the dropdown with its codec, channels, bitrate, and bit depth, so you
   can pick a different one if you'd rather have, say, the 2.0 mix
   instead of 5.1, or LPCM instead of DTS-HD MA.
4. Name each chapter, using whichever of the four methods below suits
   the disc, then click Extract & Split.

NAMING CHAPTERS - FOUR WAYS
- From disc: if the playlist has chapter names embedded on it, they're
  filled in automatically as soon as you select the playlist - no
  button needed. The "from disc" tag next to a field shows this
  happened; it flips to "edited" if you change that name yourself.
- Paste: paste a plain tracklist (one song per line, in the same order
  as the chapters) into the box - it fills the chapter fields
  automatically as you type or paste, no button to click. Leading
  numbering like "1." or "01 -" is stripped automatically.
- Import Tracklist...: reads a tracklist file. Handles plain .txt,
  .cue, .json, and disc-meta .nfo files. If the app found candidate
  files sitting in the disc folder (BDInfo.txt, Track Listing.txt,
  bdmt_*.xml etc), it'll mention them - these usually came bundled
  with the rip and are normally exactly the right tracklist.
- Search Online...: looks up the album on MusicBrainz, by artist/album
  text or by the disc's barcode (the UPC/EAN under the barcode lines on
  the case). The barcode identifies the exact edition, so it's worth
  using instead of artist/album when a release has multiple regional
  pressings or reissues with different bonus tracks. Good for
  well-known standard releases either way. LIMITED/BOUTIQUE EDITIONS
  (small-run audiophile Blu-ray Pure Audio / Surround Series discs,
  mail-order exclusives, etc) are very often missing from MusicBrainz
  entirely, or only the parent CD/digital release is indexed - if the
  track count shown looks nothing like your chapter count, that's the
  usual reason. Import Tracklist is more reliable for that kind of disc.

Whichever method you use, nothing is applied until you review and
accept the proposed matches - matched chapters are pre-checked,
mismatched/unmatched ones are left for you to decide.

COMMON ERRORS
- "mkvextract failed" / "Could not read chapters": usually means the
  selected file wasn't readable as-is (e.g. a corrupted or incomplete
  rip). Try re-scanning, or check the file plays correctly elsewhere.
- "X output file(s) already exist": the app never overwrites existing
  files silently - you'll be asked to confirm before anything in the
  output folder gets replaced.
- Tool not found on startup: mkvmerge, mkvextract, ffmpeg, and ffprobe
  all need to be installed and reachable - either on your system PATH,
  or pointed at directly via the Browse button in that dialog. MKVToolNix
  provides mkvmerge/mkvextract together; ffmpeg provides ffmpeg/ffprobe
  together, so locating one usually finds its pair automatically too.

IF AN EXTRACTION IS INTERRUPTED
If the app is closed, crashes, or a job is cancelled partway through,
just select the same source and output folders and click
Extract & Split again. The app detects the in-progress manifest in
the work folder and offers to resume exactly where it left off -
skipping the extraction step entirely if it already finished, and
skipping any chapters that were already split.
For advanced/manual recovery (e.g. the manifest was deleted, or
extraction finished but you want different track names), the
intermediate _audio_extracted.mkv is left in the work folder and can
be split directly from the command line with split_now.py - see the
README for the exact syntax.

SETTINGS & LOGS
Tool paths and last-used folders are remembered in
%USERPROFILE%\\.disc_track_splitter\\settings.json. Use "Open Log"
during/after a run to see exactly what each external tool was told to
do - the most useful thing to include if you're reporting a bug.
