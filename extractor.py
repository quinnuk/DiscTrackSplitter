extractor.py

Core logic for scanning Blu-ray disc folders, finding Dolby Atmos audio
tracks, reading chapter markers, and splitting the Atmos stream into
individual named song files.

Requires on PATH (or configured via settings.py):
    - mkvmerge / mkvextract  (MKVToolNix)
    - ffmpeg / ffprobe

This module has no GUI dependencies - it can be used standalone or
imported by main.py.

    - If every entry has a start_seconds (from a CUE sheet's INDEX 01

    - Otherwise (plain text/NFO/JSON names with no timing), align
      positionally: tracklist entry i -> chapter i. There's no timing
      information to align by in that case, and straight position order
      is what a pasted "one song per line" list means.

    chapter rather than only stopping between chapters.

    audio_track: the single audio track (Atmos, LPCM, DTS-HD MA, etc.)
    to keep - every other audio track on the playlist is dropped.
    track_names: maps chapter index (1-based) -> song title.
    Returns list of final output file paths.

    cleanup_work_folder: if True (default), deletes work_folder (and the
    large intermediate _audio_extracted.mkv inside it, and the job
    manifest) once splitting has finished successfully. If splitting
    raises - including cancellation - the work folder and manifest are
    left in place so the job can be resumed. Set to False to always keep
    the intermediate file around (e.g. for debugging).

    overwrite: paths pre-approved for overwrite by the caller (see
    preflight_check()). Extraction still runs even if this ends up wrong
    (e.g. the disk changed since preflight) - the collision is caught by
    split_chapters afterwards rather than skipped, so nothing gets
    silently overwritten either way.

    cancel_event: if set while running, stops as soon as the current
    external-tool call can be safely terminated and raises JobCancelled.
    The manifest is updated to status "cancelled" first, so the job shows
    up as resumable rather than merely failed.

    resume: if True and work_folder already has a manifest from a
    previous run of this same job, reuse whatever it recorded as already
    done - skip re-extracting the intermediate audio file if it's already
    there, and skip re-splitting any chapter whose output file is already
    on disk. This folds "resume" and "retry failed chapters" into one
    behaviour: since progress is tracked by which output files actually
    exist, there's nothing left to distinguish a plain resume from a
    retry-what-failed - both mean "don't redo what's already done".

    log_path: if given, every progress message is also appended to this
    file (with a UTC timestamp), independent of progress_cb - this is
    what an "Open log" button in the UI can point at, and it survives
    even if the caller passes cleanup_work_folder=True.
